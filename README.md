# swirl repo
ebuilds for the `swirl` Gentoo repo. These are for applications I use that aren't present in Gentoo repositories, or for my own stuff.

# Usage
cba will add later

# Notes
passman++ and libpassman require Qt 6, which currently has not been merged to the Gentoo Qt project upstream (see [gentoo/qt#224](https://github.com/gentoo/qt/pull/224)).
